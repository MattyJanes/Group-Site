      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little, it's still small at heart. <br> We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches.</p>
      <p>Our unique approach to brewing and keen eye to every detail fosters creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.</p>
      <p>On site, we are pleased to offer a unique brewing experience, featuring a full service tasting room with an exquisite menu of fine dining drinking food, a curated selection of cocktails, glass pours of selected wines, and 20 taps of Dandy beers.</p>
      <p>We share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, experiences, <br> and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special.</p>

        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>Even dandies have origins.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business. </h3>
        <div class="indeximage"><img id="indeximage" alt="indeximage" src="Chef%20Merritt%20Gordon.jpg"></div>
        <p id="indexp">The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business, they graduated and went their
          separate ways. They cross paths again years later to discuss an interest, and a passion. 
        </p>
        <p>In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made sweeping changes to the brewing
          industry in Alberta, allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben Leon,
          a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been growing their home-brew experience, not only in size but
          also in knowledge. Over the course of a few years of practice, learning, and many batches, they began
          brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse. 
        </p>
        <p>While honing skills, the two were developing a keen taste for the growing selection of Craft beer flooding
          into Alberta. Much of their guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in Alberta,
          and a close friend. Between the three of them, the topic of starting something amazing often came up
          over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure it was possible under old laws.
          Changes in law meant it was possible. 
        </p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>Discussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into plans.
        <br>What it always boiled down to
          was that the brewery would have to be exciting, forward thinking,<br> and outside the traditional thought box
          for breweries in the province. <br> Exciting beer styles, quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of
          production.
        </p>
        <p>Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school friend studying chemistry on the West coast. <br> On his
          return to Calgary, and with a new-found interest in brewing and craft beer, he got in touch with an old
          high school friend.<br> A home brew batch later, and a discussion of wild dreams, he was added to the
          group. <br> He was a much needed addition bringing expertise in laboratory process and a deep
          understanding of the science behind the beer. 
        </p>
        <p>When the laws were officially changed in December 2013, the four Dandies moved quickly to hammer <br> out
          the final details for The Dandy Brewing Company. 
        </p>
        <p>In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. <br>April 2014 the lease was signed. <br> June
          2014 the brewhouse was built.<br> August 2014 the brewing began. <br>September 2014 the beer hit the
          shelves. <br> April 2015 the first draught accounts started pouring.<br> November 2015 the Tap Room opened.<br>
          January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity was completed.
        </p>
        <p>April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room,<br> a new production
          facility and full service tasting room located in the heart of Ramsay, Calgary. <br> Fine Dining drinking food.
          Dandy beers. Cocktails. wine. The full Dandy experience.
